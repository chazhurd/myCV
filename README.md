I have a website on AWS to showcase my projects and html abilities. So far it has a fun game with a good amount of JS and business idea page for angel investors or curious minds.

Spot was an idea I had in College. Took it to a contest and ran all the way to the top. There was no technical first place, but we were funded with the 2nd largest reward and named most market ready business. The prototype is still under construction, we've added payment and sandboxed it. Its nearly ready a :) Just some final adjustments and were ready to host and make money!
