          <p>Part time Painter where I was self-employed. I took over as my own boss and would meet, bid, and work on my own jobs. Working with many different contractors and citizens, this position taught me to be very responsible. This position also required me to hire a helping hand which hours and pay was managed by me. I worked this position while attending College full time, it offered me a way to have flexibility in prioritizing my time properly amongst the two. During this time, I was also engaging in home theater sales via online platforms, as far as creating a custom ASP.net/JS/CSS + bootstrap website where people could order merchandise from</p>

          <h4>Bachelors</h4>
          <p>Eastern provided significant formal training of Software Engineering such as OOP design and programming, C and UNIX programming, and an in-depth multi-quarter sequence of Java. Intensive mathematical concepts were taught through Calculus 2, Discrete Mathematics and Algorithms. Eastern Washington University is an Accredited College by the Computing Accreditation Commission of ABET, there I learned 10 different programming languages and used more than 10 different IDEâ€™s. Waterfall and Agile development principles as well as version control was taught there as well. Professors not only taught different languages and their respective code but also required the understanding of common coding principles such as the pillars of OOP and Design Patterns.   </p>

          <h4>Associates Degree</h4>
          <p>Spokane Falls provided a great base start of education. There I learned most of my engineering Mathematics and Sciences. Calculus 2 and all 4 major sciences were learned there. Prior to attending, becoming an Engineer was certain however which type was unknown. I chose the biological as it was one of the most difficult to understand and was fun to study. I took two years of French, studied various sciences, and took more than the needed amount of general education to understand what I wanted and be sure of what future I will proceed with.  </p><br>
